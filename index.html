    <p>In 2018 I decided to engage more with the larger technical community. I knew I
wanted to speak at a technical conference, but I had zero experience finding
conferences, filling out
abstracts, and submitting before CFPs close. I gave a first talk at FutureStack 2017,
but that was a bit different since it was a vendor conference and Airbnb was
invited to speak there. Also a manager signed me up before telling me about it
(thanks Joey!), so it wasn&rsquo;t planned. So I started submitting proposals in the
middle of summer 2018. I got a
rejection, and three acceptances (yay!), and I was surprised by a keynote
acceptance. I ended up speaking at ONS Europe in
Amsterdam in September, and KubeCon NA in December. The ONS talk wasn&rsquo;t
recorded, but it was also more of a practice run of the content I would finalize
for KubeCon NA. I couldn&rsquo;t squeeze in VelocityConf NYC into my schedule, and was
sad to miss it (but I was having fun in Hong Kong instead). Also I started to
receive pointed questions about whether I could really code if I&rsquo;m constantly
speaking/travelling :). And to be fair, I care a LOT about the quality of my
slides, and it is time consuming for me to make them.</p>

<p>What I was most terrified about was standing up there and saying something
universally Wrong or Bad. But people were engaged. There was note-taking,
picture-taking, &ldquo;aha&rdquo;s, and a lot of followup discussion both in person and on
twitter.</p>

<p>I also attended a few meetups and conferences, my favorite of which was Building
Upwards by Vicki Cheung at Lyft. I loved listening to and chatting with women
and non-binary folk about infrastructure.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Evolve Airbnb's microservices architecture with a
      new infrastructure based on kubernetes and the
      principle that "everything about a project is in one

      nearly 40% of hundreds of production-facing services
      on the new infrastructure</li>
    <li> Develop tooling that simplifies k8s files </li>
    <li> Develop tooling that automates building a "hello
      world" service </li>

    services (kubectl++ wrapper) </li>
    <li> Prototype improved docker-based builds and deploys for
      kubernetes services </li>
    <li> Debug and improve overall stability of
      infrastructure as part of kubernetes adoption (logs,
      metrics, service discovery)</li>
    <li> Develop a solution for running most k8s services as an
    unprivileged user without compromising usability and
    debuggability</li>
    <li> Give external talks about Airbnb infrastructure,

      team, solving major outages (ex: related to
      Spectre/Meltdown in late 2017-early 2018)</li>
    <li> Lead a "merge queue" project that scaled out
      contributions and production deploys to a monolithic
      codebase for 500-1000+ engineers and millions of lines
      of code </li>
    <li> Made significant startup time improvements to a
      Rails monolith in development by taking advantage of advanced Rails
      autoloading concepts and behavior </li>
    <li> Automate parts of the developer workflow (ex:
      automatic reverts) to reduce time to remediation for
      incidents </li>
    <li> Reliability and efficiency improvements to scale
      tests, builds, and deploys for hundreds of developers
      </li>
    <li> Comfortable working with: ruby, rails, golang,
      python, java, bash, unix systems, javascript, node,
      mysql, docker, kubernetes, chef, terraform, AWS integration,

  Here are some external talks I've given. Reach out if you'd like me to speak
  at your conference!
</p>

<h1> KubeCon NA 2018, keynote </h1>
<p>
  <b>Abstract:</b> You've already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnb’s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:
1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers
2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, validation, build and deploy strategies
3. Tooling: Creating and distributing a kubectl wrapper
