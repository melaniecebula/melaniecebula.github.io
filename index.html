    <p>In 2018 I decided to engage more with the larger technical community. I knew I
wanted to speak at a technical conference, but I had zero experience finding
conferences, filling out
abstracts, and submitting before CFPs close. I gave a first talk at FutureStack 2017,
but that was a bit different since it was a vendor conference and Airbnb was
invited to speak there. Also a manager signed me up before telling me about it
(thanks Joey!), so it wasn&rsquo;t planned. So I started submitting proposals in the
middle of summer 2018. I got a
rejection, and three acceptances (yay!), and I was surprised by a keynote
acceptance. I ended up speaking at ONS Europe in
Amsterdam in September, and KubeCon NA in December. The ONS talk wasn&rsquo;t
recorded, but it was also more of a practice run of the content I would finalize
for KubeCon NA. I couldn&rsquo;t squeeze in VelocityConf NYC into my schedule, and was
sad to miss it (but I was having fun in Hong Kong instead). Also I started to
receive pointed questions about whether I could really code if I&rsquo;m constantly
speaking/travelling :). And to be fair, I care a LOT about the quality of my
slides, and it is time consuming for me to make them.</p>

<p>What I was most terrified about was standing up there and saying something
universally Wrong or Bad. But people were engaged. There was note-taking,
picture-taking, &ldquo;aha&rdquo;s, and a lot of followup discussion both in person and on
twitter.</p>

<p>I also attended a few meetups and conferences, my favorite of which was Building
Upwards by Vicki Cheung at Lyft. I loved listening to and chatting with women
and non-binary folk about infrastructure.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Evolve Airbnb's microservices architecture with a
      new infrastructure based on kubernetes and the
      principle that "everything about a project is in one
      place in git, and deployed with one process", with
      nearly 40% of hundreds of production-facing services
      on the new infrastructure</li>
    <li> Develop tooling that simplifies k8s files </li>
    <li> Develop tooling that automates building a "hello
      world" service </li>
    <li> Develop tooling that simplifies interacting with
    services (kubectl++ wrapper) </li>
    <li> Prototype improved docker-based builds and deploys for
      kubernetes services </li>
    <li> Debug and improve overall stability of
      infrastructure as part of kubernetes adoption (logs,
      metrics, service discovery)</li>
    <li> Develop a solution for running most k8s services as an
    unprivileged user without compromising usability and
    debuggability</li>
    <li> Give external talks about Airbnb infrastructure,

    <li> Visit Airbnb offices around the world to connect

      team, solving major outages (ex: related to
      Spectre/Meltdown in late 2017-early 2018)</li>
    <li> Lead a "merge queue" project that scaled out
      contributions and production deploys to a monolithic
      codebase for 500-1000+ engineers and millions of lines
      of code </li>
    <li> Made significant startup time improvements to a
      Rails monolith in development by taking advantage of advanced Rails
      autoloading concepts and behavior </li>
    <li> Automate parts of the developer workflow (ex:
      automatic reverts) to reduce time to remediation for
      incidents </li>
    <li> Reliability and efficiency improvements to scale
      tests, builds, and deploys for hundreds of developers
      </li>
    <li> Comfortable working with: ruby, rails, golang,
      python, java, bash, unix systems, javascript, node,
      mysql, docker, kubernetes, chef, terraform, AWS integration,
      CI/CD, developer tooling, writing integration tests,
      pagerduty, git/github, incident response, etc

  Here are some external talks I've given. Reach out if you'd like me to speak
  at your conference!
</p>

<h1> KubeCon NA 2018, keynote </h1>
<p>
  <b>Abstract:</b> You've already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnbâ€™s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:
1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers
2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, validation, build and deploy strategies
3. Tooling: Creating and distributing a kubectl wrapper
