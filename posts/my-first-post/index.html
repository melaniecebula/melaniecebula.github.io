  <div><p>In 2018 I decided to engage more with the larger technical community. I had a
few goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Speak at more technical conferences</li>
<li>Engage with other people/companies on twitter</li>
<li>Start a technical blog</li>
<li>Contribute to more open source</li>
<li>Attend more events aimed at women/non-binary folks (and maybe organize one!)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I did.</p>

<p><strong>Speak at more technical conferences</strong></p>

<p>I knew I
wanted to speak at a technical conference, but I had zero experience finding
conferences, filling out
abstracts, and submitting before CFPs close. I gave a first talk at FutureStack 2017,
but that was a bit different since it was a vendor conference and Airbnb was
invited to speak there. Also a manager signed me up before telling me about it
(thanks Joey!), so it wasn&rsquo;t planned. So I started submitting proposals in the
middle of summer 2018. I got a
rejection, and three acceptances (yay!), and I was surprised by a keynote
acceptance. I ended up speaking at ONS Europe in
Amsterdam in September, and KubeCon NA in December. The ONS talk wasn&rsquo;t
recorded, but it was also more of a practice run of the content I would finalize
for KubeCon NA. I couldn&rsquo;t squeeze in VelocityConf NYC into my schedule, and was
sad to miss it (but I was having fun in Hong Kong instead). I love giving talks,
but they&rsquo;re time consuming for me. In addition to practicing the presentation, I
spend a lot of hours drafting content and finalizing the slides. I spent even
more time polishing my KubeCon slides, because I knew a lot of people would see
it :).</p>

<p>What I was most terrified about was standing up there and saying something
universally Wrong or Bad. But people were engaged. There was note-taking,
picture-taking, &ldquo;aha&rdquo;s, and a lot of followup discussion both in person and on
twitter. What I loved most was meeting with people and other companies and
comparing/constrasting how we&rsquo;ve tried to solve different problems. And there
are a lot of problems when you completely change your infrastructure to
Kubernetes. I walked away with a treasure trove of notes and ideas to share with
our infra teams, and feel re-energized about many of the technical and
organizational problems we&rsquo;ve been facing.</p>

<p>status: super success!</p>

<p><strong>Engage with other people/companies on twitter</strong></p>

<p>I started picking up my twitter game shortly before the conferences. I put my
twitter handle on all my slides too :). I got a TON of engagement from KubeCon. I
went from ~400 to ~1000 followers, and finally feel engaged on the platform.
It&rsquo;s a great way to see where things are going in infra in real-time.</p>

<p>status: success</p>

<p><strong>Start a technical blog</strong></p>

<p>Well, I started setting up this blog on December 30th. I waffled a bit on how to
setup it up, but settled for using hugo.</p>

<p>status: kinda?</p>

<p><strong>Contribute to more open source</strong></p>

<p>I set up kubernetes locally and commented on and tried to work on an issue. Liz
Frost gave me a lot of 1:1 help reproing the issue. But the issue was too hard
for me to complete on a compressed timeframe at KubeCon :). So I&rsquo;ll have to pick
this up later.</p>

<p>There was an uptick on open source contributions from Airbnb engineers in 2018
(My coworker Ramya found a scheduler bug related to balancing pods across
availability zones, and her fix will be in 1.14!!), and we&rsquo;ll likely make more
contributions in 2019. For example, I know our Continuous Integration team is looking at current
open source image building solutions, and our Continuous Delivery team is
looking at moving us to Spinnaker.</p>

<p>status: failure, I can do better!</p>

<p><strong>Attend more events aimed at women/non-binary folks (and maybe organize one!)</strong></p>

<p>I also attended a few meetups and conferences, my favorite of which was Building
Upwards by Vicki Cheung at Lyft. I loved listening to and chatting with women
and non-binary folk about infrastructure. I wanted to plan one of these for late
2018 at Airbnb HQ, but we&rsquo;re pushing it to 2019.</p>

<p>status: mostly success</p>

<p><strong>2018 Contributions</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I did a lot of coding in 2018 at work:
<img src="http://melaniecebula.github.io/img/github_work_2018.png" alt="work github" /></p>

<p>Although the darker green boxes were actually automated refactors of 100+
services (now you can run refactors as a bot user to not mess with your
contributions if you&rsquo;d like).</p>

<p><strong>2018 Highlights / Lowlights</strong></p>

<p>Lowlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spectre/Meltdown fallout continued into January (we also experience peak load in early January&ndash; fun!)</li>
<li>This one guy in PR kept trying to stop me from speaking and was super rude</li>
<li>Unexpected and sudden departure of two close teammates :(</li>
<li>Imposter syndrome, my old friend</li>
<li>&ldquo;hey melanie can you debug this because you touched this code at some point and it&rsquo;s probably your fault, please prove me wrong&rdquo; (I actually generally like debugging issues, but I <strong>hate</strong> any assumptions that a problem is my fault and that I am itherefore obligated to investigate, and this happened a bunch of times)</li>
<li>&ldquo;hey melanie, why aren&rsquo;t you rolling back this totally broken infra change&rdquo; and &ldquo;hey melanie, why are you rolling back my totally broken infra change&rdquo; (AKA between a customer engineer and an infra engineer)</li>
<li>&ldquo;hey melanie, you worked on this before so can you do this additional work that we want to happen but don&rsquo;t want to do&rdquo; (negative side effect of working on everything)</li>
</ul>

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>My project (new way of configuring and managing services) became general access for new services in April</li>
<li>My project (streamlined way of migrating existing services to the new way) became general access in November</li>
<li>Leadership of different engineering groups signed off on migrating their services!</li>
<li>Business trips to Dublin, Amsterdam, Portland, and Seattle.</li>
<li>I got promoted to senior software engineer! (well technically, from software engineer to software engineer since we use levels)</li>
<li>I got to work all over infra this year (service discovery/networking, CI/CD, developer tooling, security, etc)</li>
<li>Speaker training and keynote at KubeCon</li>
<li>The CEO and CTO know my project :). The project does have a hype name and catchphrase, which always helps.</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked on a lot of interesting problems this year, and look forward to sharing
my solutions now that the blog is up!</p>
