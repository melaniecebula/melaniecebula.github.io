			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I decided to engage more with the larger technical community. I knew I
wanted to speak at a technical conference, but I had zero experience finding
conferences, filling out
abstracts, and submitting before CFPs close. I gave a first talk at FutureStack 2017,
but that was a bit different since it was a vendor conference and Airbnb was
invited to speak there. Also a manager signed me up before telling me about it
(thanks Joey!), so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t planned. So I started submitting proposals in the
middle of summer 2018. I got a
rejection, and three acceptances (yay!), and I was surprised by a keynote
acceptance. I ended up speaking at ONS Europe in
Amsterdam in September, and KubeCon NA in December. The ONS talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t
recorded, but it was also more of a practice run of the content I would finalize
for KubeCon NA. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t squeeze in VelocityConf NYC into my schedule, and was
sad to miss it (but I was having fun in Hong Kong instead). Also I started to
receive pointed questions about whether I could really code if I&amp;rsquo;m constantly
speaking/travelling :). And to be fair, I care a LOT about the quality of my
slides, and it is time consuming for me to make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was most terrified about was standing up there and saying something
universally Wrong or Bad. But people were engaged. There was note-taking,
picture-taking, &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;s, and a lot of followup discussion both in person and on
twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended a few meetups and conferences, my favorite of which was Building
Upwards by Vicki Cheung at Lyft. I loved listening to and chatting with women
and non-binary folk about infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
