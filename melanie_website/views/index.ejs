            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>Melanie</strong>.  I study <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>, and have been a fledgling hacker for 2 years now. I just finished my summer internship at Facebook, and this semester I am a TA for Data Structures.
              I am interested in open source, working on my shell environment and vimrc, javascript hacks, pythonic code, mobile development, learning new languages and trying out new things in software engineering.
              I'm also a bit of a foodie, a classically trained musician, and have been taking swing dancing classes for a year.
              This website is pretty old now (and the fruits of my very first time learning to code), but feel free to look around, or take a peek at my <a href="MelanieResume.pdf"> resume </a>.
                </p>

        <div class="tab-pane" id="about">
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>My Musical Past</h2>
                <p>I really liked playing the upright bass.  Still do.  But I had actually planned on attending music conservatory.  I spent a lot of my time in high school commuting all around Southern California to learn, rehearse, and perform.  On occassion I would go upstate or tour with a group in a foreign country.</p>
                <p>When you first start playing an instrument, its the pressing things you work on: hand position, intonation, bow placement.  But the wonderful thing is, after a few years things begin to change.  You realize that if you play this note 'just so', with the bow at this speed, placed here, with this note being eased into, with this amount of vibrato, etc- you realize that this is exactly, perfectly what you want.  And if you can get not one or two notes, but perhaps an entire piece mastered in this way, the feeling is indescribable. </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Skill Acquisition</h2>
                <p>It took a lot of courage and honesty to realize that I didn't want to spend my entire life being just a musician; I wanted to spend my entire life acquiring and honing as many skills as I could.  I wanted the freedom to pursue not just one, but many wonderful, fascinating interests.</p>
                <p>And so, having not focused on classes or grades in many years, it was with trepidation that I applied to UC Berkeley.  Somehow I got accepted.  Yay! </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Berkeley</h2>
                <p> I am an officer of Hackers@Berkeley, the largest EECS club on campus.  I also TA for the Data Structures course here.
                  I enjoy teaching workshops, debugging student code, and taking interesting classes.  I also enjoy ditching class and eating good food. </p>

                <p><strong>Movie Mashups:</strong>  Use a markov chain to mash two movie plots together.  Use a shitty classifier to identify main characters and only use one for maximum mashiness

                <p><strong>Pokepon:</strong>Pokepon is a multiplayer game that combines the battle elements of the Pokemon game with the dance and rhythm elements of Patapon (a game sort of like Dance Dance Revolution). Start a battle, send the link to your friends, and type the battle commands in time with the beat of a song on your Soundcloud playlist. This game won the Firebase API award at the PennApps Hackathon in September 2013. I worked on this with Thanh Hai Mai,  Stephanie Djidjev, and Achal Dave. Pokepon uses HTML5, CSS, node.js, Express, Javascript, Firebase, and the Soundcloud API.

                <p><strong>Boxel (open-source contribution to voxel.js):</strong>  My friends and I dedicated a hackathon to creating a multiplayer Capture the Flag game for the multiplayer server for voxel.js, and minecraft-inspired voxel game built in the browser with Javascript.  Implemented team logic and block attributes for gameplay.

              <p><strong>Scheme Art Contest Submission:</strong>  My submission for the art contest at the end of CS61A.  Using the Scheme Interpreter that I built in Python, I implemented a module for Python Turtle Graphics that enables 3d graphics using perspective projection and some other cool math.  Used this to recreate Sierpinski's Triangles in 3D.  Written entirely in Scheme.  <strong>Won</strong> first place for the heavyweight division.
