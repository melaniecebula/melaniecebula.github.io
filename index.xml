			<title>Starting a Blog and 2018 in Review</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I decided to engage more with the larger technical community. I had a
few goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak at more technical conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with other people/companies on twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a technical blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to more open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend more events aimed at women/non-binary folks (and maybe organize one!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak at more technical conferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I
wanted to speak at a technical conference, but I had zero experience finding
conferences, filling out
abstracts, and submitting before CFPs close. I gave a first talk at FutureStack 2017,
but that was a bit different since it was a vendor conference and Airbnb was
invited to speak there. Also a manager signed me up before telling me about it
(thanks Joey!), so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t planned. So I started submitting proposals in the
middle of summer 2018. I got a
rejection, and three acceptances (yay!), and I was surprised by a keynote
acceptance. I ended up speaking at ONS Europe in
Amsterdam in September, and KubeCon NA in December. The ONS talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t
recorded, but it was also more of a practice run of the content I would finalize
for KubeCon NA. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t squeeze in VelocityConf NYC into my schedule, and was
sad to miss it (but I was having fun in Hong Kong instead). I love giving talks,
but they&amp;rsquo;re time consuming for me. In addition to practicing the presentation, I
spend a lot of hours drafting content and finalizing the slides. I spent even
more time polishing my KubeCon slides, because I knew a lot of people would see
it :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was most terrified about was standing up there and saying something
universally Wrong or Bad. But people were engaged. There was note-taking,
picture-taking, &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;s, and a lot of followup discussion both in person and on
twitter. What I loved most was meeting with people and other companies and
comparing/constrasting how we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to solve different problems. And there
are a lot of problems when you completely change your infrastructure to
Kubernetes. I walked away with a treasure trove of notes and ideas to share with
our infra teams, and feel re-energized about many of the technical and
organizational problems we&amp;rsquo;ve been facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: super success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage with other people/companies on twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started picking up my twitter game shortly before the conferences. I put my
twitter handle on all my slides too :). I got a TON of engagement from KubeCon. I
went from ~400 to ~1000 followers, and finally feel engaged on the platform.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to see where things are going in infra in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a technical blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I started setting up this blog on December 30th. I waffled a bit on how to
setup it up, but settled for using hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: kinda?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute to more open source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up kubernetes locally and commented on and tried to work on an issue. Liz
Frost gave me a lot of 1:1 help reproing the issue. But the issue was too hard
for me to complete on a compressed timeframe at KubeCon :). So I&amp;rsquo;ll have to pick
this up later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an uptick on open source contributions from Airbnb engineers in 2018
(My coworker Ramya found a scheduler bug related to balancing pods across
availability zones, and her fix will be in 1.14!!), and we&amp;rsquo;ll likely make more
contributions in 2019. For example, I know our Continuous Integration team is looking at current
open source image building solutions, and our Continuous Delivery team is
looking at moving us to Spinnaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: failure, I can do better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend more events aimed at women/non-binary folks (and maybe organize one!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended a few meetups and conferences, my favorite of which was Building
Upwards by Vicki Cheung at Lyft. I loved listening to and chatting with women
and non-binary folk about infrastructure. I wanted to plan one of these for late
2018 at Airbnb HQ, but we&amp;rsquo;re pushing it to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: mostly success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did a lot of coding in 2018 at work:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://melaniecebula.github.io/img/github_work_2018.png&#34; alt=&#34;work github&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the darker green boxes were actually automated refactors of 100+
services (now you can run refactors as a bot user to not mess with your
contributions if you&amp;rsquo;d like).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Highlights / Lowlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spectre/Meltdown fallout continued into January (we also experience peak load in early January&amp;ndash; fun!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one guy in PR kept trying to stop me from speaking and was super rude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexpected and sudden departure of two close teammates :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imposter syndrome, my old friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;hey melanie can you debug this because you touched this code at some point and it&amp;rsquo;s probably your fault, please prove me wrong&amp;rdquo; (I actually generally like debugging issues, but I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; any assumptions that a problem is my fault and that I am therefore obligated to investigate, and this happened a bunch of times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;hey melanie, you worked on this before so can you do this additional work that we want to happen but don&amp;rsquo;t want to do&amp;rdquo; (negative side effect of working on everything&amp;ndash; sometimes it can all add up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally contorted our OKRs so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to make this work for kubernetes services&amp;rdquo; (thankfully this goes does as adoption increases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My project (new way of configuring and managing services) became general access for new services in April&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My project (streamlined way of migrating existing services to the new way) became general access in November&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership of different engineering groups signed off on migrating their services!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business trips to Dublin, Amsterdam, Portland, and Seattle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got promoted to senior software engineer! (well technically, from software engineer to software engineer since we use levels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to work all over infra this year (service discovery/networking, CI/CD, developer tooling, security, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker training and keynote at KubeCon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CEO and CTO know my project :). The project does have a hype name and catchphrase, which always helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on a lot of interesting problems this year, and look forward to sharing
my solutions now that the blog is up!&lt;/p&gt;

    I&#39;m Melanie.  I&#39;m a software engineer. I live in San
    Francisco, but travel often.
    Currently, I work on infrastructure at Airbnb.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;../img/melanie.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; Current work &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Airbnb, Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; Evolve Airbnb&#39;s microservices architecture with a
      new infrastructure based on kubernetes and the
      principle that &#34;everything about a project is in one
      place in git, and deployed with one process&#34;, with
      nearly 40% of hundreds of production-facing services
      on the new infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop tooling that simplifies k8s files &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop tooling that automates building a &#34;hello
      world&#34; service &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop tooling that simplifies interacting with
    services (kubectl++ wrapper) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Prototype improved docker-based builds and deploys for
      kubernetes services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Debug and improve overall stability of
      infrastructure as part of kubernetes adoption (logs,
      metrics, service discovery)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop a solution for running most k8s services as an
    unprivileged user without compromising usability and
    debuggability&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Give external talks about Airbnb infrastructure,
      reaching over 10,000+ members of the community&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Visit Airbnb offices around the world to connect
      with developers and their needs &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Previously lead infrastructure incident response
      team, solving major outages (ex: related to
      Spectre/Meltdown in late 2017-early 2018)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Lead a &#34;merge queue&#34; project that scaled out
      contributions and production deploys to a monolithic
      codebase for 500-1000+ engineers and millions of lines
      of code &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Made significant startup time improvements to a
      Rails monolith in development by taking advantage of advanced Rails
      autoloading concepts and behavior &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Automate parts of the developer workflow (ex:
      automatic reverts) to reduce time to remediation for
      incidents &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Reliability and efficiency improvements to scale
      tests, builds, and deploys for hundreds of developers
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Comfortable working with: ruby, rails, golang,
      python, java, bash, unix systems, javascript, node,
      mysql, docker, kubernetes, chef, terraform, AWS integration,
      CI/CD, developer tooling, writing integration tests,
      pagerduty, git/github, incident response, etc
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; Previous work &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Airbnb, Payments&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Built out Employee Travel Credit Program and Airbnb Credit&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Designed and created data models, backend, and frontend using MySQL, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Processes millions of USD in transfers between accounts&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Dat Project, Datscript&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Open source contribution to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://datproject.org/about&#34;&gt;Dat Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Created a parser for a simple format based on indenation in node.js&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Simplifies writing scripts for scientists&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Facebook, Pages Mobile Team&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Pages Draft Posts for iOS: Page admins can create, edit, delete, and publish drafts&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

  Here are some external talks I&#39;ve given. Reach out if you&#39;d like me to speak
  at your conference!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt; KubeCon NA 2018, keynote &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; You&#39;ve already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnbâ€™s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:
1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers
2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, validation, build and deploy strategies
3. Tooling: Creating and distributing a kubectl wrapper

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt; FutureStack NYC 2017 &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; When, why, and how to move from a monolithic architecture to a
  microservices architecture
