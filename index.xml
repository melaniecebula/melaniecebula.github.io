			<title>Starting a Blog and 2018 in Review</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I decided to engage more with the larger technical community. I had a
few goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak at more technical conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with other people/companies on twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a technical blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to more open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend more events aimed at women/non-binary folks (and maybe organize one!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak at more technical conferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I
wanted to speak at a technical conference, but I had zero experience finding
conferences, filling out
abstracts, and submitting before CFPs close. I gave a first talk at FutureStack 2017,
but that was a bit different since it was a vendor conference and Airbnb was
invited to speak there. Also a manager signed me up before telling me about it
(thanks Joey!), so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t planned. So I started submitting proposals in the
middle of summer 2018. I got a
rejection, and three acceptances (yay!), and I was surprised by a keynote
acceptance. I ended up speaking at ONS Europe in
Amsterdam in September, and KubeCon NA in December. The ONS talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t
recorded, but it was also more of a practice run of the content I would finalize
for KubeCon NA. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t squeeze in VelocityConf NYC into my schedule, and was
sad to miss it (but I was having fun in Hong Kong instead). I love giving talks,
but they&amp;rsquo;re time consuming for me. In addition to practicing the presentation, I
spend a lot of hours drafting content and finalizing the slides. I spent even
more time polishing my KubeCon slides, because I knew a lot of people would see
it :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was most terrified about was standing up there and saying something
universally Wrong or Bad. But people were engaged. There was note-taking,
picture-taking, &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;s, and a lot of followup discussion both in person and on
twitter. What I loved most was meeting with people and other companies and
comparing/constrasting how we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to solve different problems. And there
are a lot of problems when you completely change your infrastructure to
Kubernetes. I walked away with a treasure trove of notes and ideas to share with
our infra teams, and feel re-energized about many of the technical and
organizational problems we&amp;rsquo;ve been facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: super success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage with other people/companies on twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started picking up my twitter game shortly before the conferences. I put my
twitter handle on all my slides too :). I got a TON of engagement from KubeCon. I
went from ~400 to ~1000 followers, and finally feel engaged on the platform.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to see where things are going in infra in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a technical blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I started setting up this blog on December 30th. I waffled a bit on how to
setup it up, but settled for using hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: kinda?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute to more open source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up kubernetes locally and commented on and tried to work on an issue. Liz
Frost gave me a lot of 1:1 help reproing the issue. But the issue was too hard
for me to complete on a compressed timeframe at KubeCon :). So I&amp;rsquo;ll have to pick
this up later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an uptick on open source contributions from Airbnb engineers in 2018
(My coworker Ramya found a scheduler bug related to balancing pods across
availability zones, and her fix will be in 1.14!!), and we&amp;rsquo;ll likely make more
contributions in 2019. For example, I know our Continuous Integration team is looking at current
open source image building solutions, and our Continuous Delivery team is
looking at moving us to Spinnaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: failure, I can do better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend more events aimed at women/non-binary folks (and maybe organize one!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended a few meetups and conferences, my favorite of which was Building
Upwards by Vicki Cheung at Lyft. I loved listening to and chatting with women
and non-binary folk about infrastructure. I wanted to plan one of these for late
2018 at Airbnb HQ, but we&amp;rsquo;re pushing it to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status: mostly success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did a lot of coding in 2018 at work:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://melaniecebula.github.io/img/github_work_2018.png&#34; alt=&#34;work github&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the darker green boxes were actually automated refactors of 100+
services (now you can run refactors as a bot user to not mess with your
contributions if you&amp;rsquo;d like).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Highlights / Lowlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spectre/Meltdown fallout continued into January (we also experience peak load in early January&amp;ndash; fun!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one guy in PR kept trying to stop me from speaking and was super rude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexpected and sudden departure of two close teammates :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imposter syndrome, my old friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;hey melanie can you debug this because you touched this code at some point and it&amp;rsquo;s probably your fault, please prove me wrong&amp;rdquo; (I actually generally like debugging issues, but I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; any assumptions that a problem is my fault and that I am therefore obligated to investigate, and this happened a bunch of times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;hey melanie, you worked on this before so can you do this additional work that we want to happen but don&amp;rsquo;t want to do&amp;rdquo; (negative side effect of working on everything&amp;ndash; sometimes it can all add up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally contorted our OKRs so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to make this work for kubernetes services&amp;rdquo; (thankfully this goes does as adoption increases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My project (new way of configuring and managing services) became general access for new services in April&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My project (streamlined way of migrating existing services to the new way) became general access in November&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership of different engineering groups signed off on migrating their services!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business trips to Dublin, Amsterdam, Portland, and Seattle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got promoted to senior software engineer! (well technically, from software engineer to software engineer since we use levels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to work all over infra this year (service discovery/networking, CI/CD, developer tooling, security, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker training and keynote at KubeCon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CEO and CTO know my project :). The project does have a hype name and catchphrase, which always helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on a lot of interesting problems this year, and look forward to sharing
my solutions now that the blog is up!&lt;/p&gt;

    I&#39;m Melanie.  I&#39;m a software engineer. I live in San
    Francisco, but travel often.
    Currently, I work on infrastructure at Airbnb.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;../img/melanie.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; Current work &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Airbnb, Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; Evolve Airbnb&#39;s microservices architecture with a
      new infrastructure based on kubernetes and the
      principle that &#34;everything about a project is in one
      place in git, and deployed with one process&#34;, with
      nearly 40% of hundreds of production-facing services
      on the new infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop tooling that simplifies k8s files &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop tooling that automates building a &#34;hello
      world&#34; service &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop tooling that simplifies interacting with
    services (kubectl++ wrapper) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Prototype improved docker-based builds and deploys for
      kubernetes services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Debug and improve overall stability of
      infrastructure as part of kubernetes adoption (logs,
      metrics, service discovery)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Develop a solution for running most k8s services as an
    unprivileged user without compromising usability and
    debuggability&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Give external talks about Airbnb infrastructure,
      reaching over 10,000+ members of the community&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Visit Airbnb offices around the world to connect
      with developers and their needs &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Previously lead infrastructure incident response
      team, solving major outages (ex: related to
      Spectre/Meltdown in late 2017-early 2018)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Lead a &#34;merge queue&#34; project that scaled out
      contributions and production deploys to a monolithic
      codebase for 500-1000+ engineers and millions of lines
      of code &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Made significant startup time improvements to a
      Rails monolith in development by taking advantage of advanced Rails
      autoloading concepts and behavior &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Automate parts of the developer workflow (ex:
      automatic reverts) to reduce time to remediation for
      incidents &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Reliability and efficiency improvements to scale
      tests, builds, and deploys for hundreds of developers
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Comfortable working with: ruby, rails, golang,
      python, java, bash, unix systems, javascript, node,
      mysql, docker, kubernetes, chef, terraform, AWS integration,
      CI/CD, developer tooling, writing integration tests,
      pagerduty, git/github, incident response, etc
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; Previous work &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Airbnb, Payments&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Built out Employee Travel Credit Program and Airbnb Credit&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Designed and created data models, backend, and frontend using MySQL, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Processes millions of USD in transfers between accounts&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Dat Project, Datscript&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Open source contribution to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://datproject.org/about&#34;&gt;Dat Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Created a parser for a simple format based on indenation in node.js&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Simplifies writing scripts for scientists&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Facebook, Pages Mobile Team&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Pages Draft Posts for iOS: Page admins can create, edit, delete, and publish drafts&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

  Here are some external talks I&#39;ve given. Reach out if you&#39;d like me to speak
  at your conference!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt; KubeCon NA 2018, keynote &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; You&#39;ve already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnb’s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:
1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers
2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, validation, build and deploy strategies
3. Tooling: Creating and distributing a kubectl wrapper

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt; FutureStack NYC 2017 &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; When, why, and how to move from a monolithic architecture to a
  microservices architecture
