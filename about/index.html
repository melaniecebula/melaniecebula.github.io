    <h2>Airbnb, Infrastructure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Evolve Airbnb's microservices architecture with a
      new infrastructure based on kubernetes and the
      principle that "everything about a project is in one
      place in git, and deployed with one process", with
      nearly 40% of hundreds of production-facing services
      on the new infrastructure</li>
    <li> Develop tooling that simplifies k8s files </li>
    <li> Develop tooling that automates building a "hello
      world" service </li>
    <li> Develop tooling that simplifies interacting with
    services (kubectl++ wrapper) </li>
    <li> Prototype improved docker-based builds and deploys for
      kubernetes services </li>
    <li> Debug and improve overall stability of
      infrastructure as part of kubernetes adoption (logs,
      metrics, service discovery)</li>
    <li> Develop a solution for running most k8s services as an
    unprivileged user without compromising usability and
    debuggability</li>
    <li> Give external talks about Airbnb infrastructure,
      reaching over 10,000+ members of the community</li>
    <li> Visit Airbnb offices around the world to connect
      with developers and their needs </li>

      team, solving major outages (ex: related to
      Spectre/Meltdown in late 2017-early 2018)</li>
    <li> Lead a "merge queue" project that scaled out
      contributions and production deploys to a monolithic
      codebase for 500-1000+ engineers and millions of lines
      of code </li>
    <li> Made significant startup time improvements to a
      Rails monolith in development by taking advantage of advanced Rails
      autoloading concepts and behavior </li>
    <li> Automate parts of the developer workflow (ex:
      automatic reverts) to reduce time to remediation for
      incidents </li>
    <li> Reliability and efficiency improvements to scale
      tests, builds, and deploys for hundreds of developers
      </li>
    <li> Comfortable working with: ruby, rails, golang,
      python, java, bash, unix systems, javascript, node,
      mysql, docker, kubernetes, chef, terraform, AWS integration,
      CI/CD, developer tooling, writing integration tests,
